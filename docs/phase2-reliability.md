# Phase 2: Reliability Implementation Guide

## Overview

Phase 2 builds upon the Phase 1 foundation to create a robust, reliable system capable of handling production workloads. The focus is on improving fault tolerance, data quality, and system observability while maintaining the simplicity established in Phase 1.

## Success Criteria

- Intelligent multi-source data routing with advanced failover
- Production-ready rate limiting across all data sources
- Comprehensive data validation with detailed quality metrics
- Advanced data quality scoring system (A-F grading)
- Memory server integration for persistent system knowledge
- 99.5% uptime target with graceful degradation
- Sub-100ms response times for cached data
- Support for 50+ symbols with concurrent requests

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Enhanced Multi-Source Architecture

Expand beyond the basic 2-source setup to support multiple data providers with intelligent routing.

**New Data Sources to Add:**

- **Polygon.io** - Real-time and historical market data (premium)
- **IEX Cloud** - Real-time data with generous free tier
- **Twelve Data** - Alternative financial data provider
- **Finnhub** - Real-time stock data and news

**Enhanced Source Manager Features:**

- **Weighted source selection** based on reliability scores
- **Cost-aware routing** to optimize API usage costs
- **Geographic failover** for latency optimization
- **Source-specific timeout configurations**
- **Intelligent request distribution** to balance load

**Implementation Requirements:**

```python
class AdvancedSourceManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.sources = {}
        self.routing_strategy = "weighted_round_robin"
        self.cost_tracker = CostTracker()
        self.reliability_scores = {}

    async def get_optimal_source(self, request_type: str, symbol: str) -> DataSource:
        # Consider: reliability, cost, latency, current load
        pass

    async def execute_with_fallback_chain(self, request: DataRequest) -> DataResponse:
        # Try sources in order of preference with intelligent backoff
        pass
```

### Step 2: Production-Grade Rate Limiting

Implement comprehensive rate limiting that goes beyond basic request counting.

**Rate Limiting Features:**

- **Token bucket algorithm** for smooth request distribution
- **Per-source rate limiting** with different limits per provider
- **Per-user rate limiting** for API consumers
- **Burst handling** for legitimate traffic spikes
- **Rate limit prediction** to prevent hitting limits
- **Graceful degradation** when approaching limits

**Advanced Rate Limiting Components:**

1. **Distributed Rate Limiter**

```python
class DistributedRateLimiter:
    def __init__(self, redis_client=None):
        self.redis = redis_client  # For distributed scenarios
        self.local_limiters = {}   # For single-instance scenarios

    async def acquire_permit(self, key: str, limit: int, window: int) -> bool:
        # Implements sliding window + token bucket hybrid
        pass

    async def get_remaining_quota(self, key: str) -> RateLimit:
        # Returns remaining requests and reset time
        pass
```

2. **Smart Request Scheduler**

```python
class RequestScheduler:
    def __init__(self):
        self.queues = {}  # Per-source request queues
        self.priorities = {}  # Request priority handling

    async def schedule_request(self, request: DataRequest) -> ScheduledExecution:
        # Optimal scheduling considering rate limits and priorities
        pass
```

**Rate Limiting Strategies:**

- **Time-based windowing** (per minute, hour, day)
- **Adaptive rate limiting** based on source performance
- **Priority-based queuing** for critical vs. nice-to-have requests
- **Rate limit sharing** across multiple application instances

### Step 3: Comprehensive Data Validation Framework

Enhance the basic validation system with advanced algorithms and comprehensive checks.

**Advanced Validation Categories:**

1. **Statistical Validation**

```python
class StatisticalValidator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.outlier_detector = OutlierDetector()
        self.trend_analyzer = TrendAnalyzer()
        self.correlation_checker = CorrelationChecker()

    async def validate_price_movement(self, current: PriceData, historical: List[PriceData]) -> ValidationResult:
        # Detect unusual price movements using statistical methods
        pass

    async def validate_volume_patterns(self, data: PriceData, context: MarketContext) -> ValidationResult:
        # Analyze volume patterns for anomalies
        pass
```

2. **Cross-Source Validation**

```python
class CrossSourceValidator:
    async def validate_against_multiple_sources(self, symbol: str, timestamp: datetime) -> ValidationResult:
        # Compare data across sources to detect inconsistencies
        pass

    async def consensus_validation(self, responses: List[DataResponse]) -> ConsensusResult:
        # Determine most reliable data when sources disagree
        pass
```

3. **Market Context Validation**

```python
class MarketContextValidator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.market_calendar = MarketCalendar()
        self.event_detector = MarketEventDetector()

    async def validate_market_hours(self, data: PriceData) -> ValidationResult:
        # Validate data against market hours and holidays
        pass

    async def validate_against_market_events(self, data: PriceData) -> ValidationResult:
        # Consider earnings, splits, dividends, etc.
        pass
```

**Validation Rules Enhancement:**

- **Time-series consistency** checks (no gaps, proper ordering)
- **Cross-symbol correlation** validation
- **Market microstructure** validation (bid-ask spreads, tick sizes)
- **Corporate action** handling (splits, dividends, mergers)
- **Currency and unit** validation
- **Source-specific quirks** handling

### Step 4: Advanced Data Quality Scoring System

Replace the binary good/bad system with a comprehensive A-F grading system.

**Quality Scoring Framework:**

1. **Multi-Dimensional Scoring**

```python
class QualityScoreCalculator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.dimensions = {
            'accuracy': AccuracyScorer(),
            'completeness': CompletenessScorer(),
            'timeliness': TimelinessScorer(),
            'consistency': ConsistencyScorer(),
            'reliability': ReliabilityScorer()
        }
        self.weights = {...}  # Configurable dimension weights

    def calculate_composite_score(self, data: PriceData, context: ValidationContext) -> QualityScore:
        # Calculate weighted composite score across all dimensions
        pass
```

```python
class DynamicQualityAdjuster:
    def __init__(self):
        self.market_conditions = MarketConditionTracker()
        self.source_performance = SourcePerformanceTracker()

    def adjust_for_market_conditions(self, base_score: float, conditions: MarketConditions) -> float:
        # Adjust quality scores based on market volatility, volume, etc.
        pass

    def adjust_for_source_reliability(self, base_score: float, source: str) -> float:
