## Phase 2 Enhancement Details

### Enhanced Source Manager Features

- Weighted source selection based on reliability scores
- Cost-aware routing to optimize API usage costs
- Geographic failover for latency optimization
- Source-specific timeout configurations
- Intelligent request distribution to balance load

### Quality Scoring Framework

- **A-Grade (90-100%):** Premium quality data (real-time, cross-validated)
- **B-Grade (80-89%):** High quality data (<5s delay, validated)
- **C-Grade (70-79%):** Acceptable quality data (<30s delay, basic validation)
- **D-Grade (60-69%):** Poor quality data (>30s delay, failed checks)
- **F-Grade (0-59%):** Unreliable data (stale, severely incomplete)

### Memory Integration Goals

- Persistent source reliability scores across restarts
- Symbol-specific learned behaviors (volumes, price ranges)
- Quality pattern recognition for proactive issue detection
- Historical performance analysis for continuous improvement
- Cross-session learning that improves over time
